# Overview

With this project I wanted to build a personal portfolio and learn cutting-edge technologies and in this case I learned Astro.

I built a minimalist portfolio that gets my information from a JSON resume schema. Thi design of this portfolio is based on Bartosz Jarocki's portfolio.

I wanted to learn one of the newest JS webframeworks Astro.
